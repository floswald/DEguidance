    "text": "One of the most vexing issues is how to cite data. This document goes through a few common scenarios not covered elsewhere.\n\nWhat is not a data citation\nMany authors initially neglect to add data citations, or do not know how to add a data citation. Often, we see authors cite papers with supplementary data, but not databases or other data:\n\n\nWe use data acquired from the NHL, dates of power outages collected by Tremblay et al (2018), augmented with information on the language and grammar skills of hockey players provided by the Ethnologue database.\n\n\n(note absence of citation for NHL and Ethnologue data). In the above example, three datasets are used, but only one is cited in some fashion.\n\nBetter\nThe above example can be improved as follows:\n\n\nWe use data acquired from the NHL (NHL, 2018), dates of power outages collected by Tremblay et al (2018, 2019), augmented with information on the language and grammar skills of hockey players provided by the Ethnologue database (Eberhard et al, 2019).\n\n\nwith the reference list having the following entries:\n\n\nEberhard, David M., Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig (eds.). 2019. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. Twenty-second edition. Dallas, Texas: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com.\nNational Hockey League. 2018. NHL Game Database 1917-2018. National Hockey League Hall of Fame, Toronto, ON. Accessed February 29, 2019.\nTremblay, Réjean, Ken Dryden, and José Theodore. 2018. “The impact of power outages on goal-keeping in the NHL”, Journal of National Hockey Leagues, vol 32, iss. 1.\nTremblay, Réjean, Ken Dryden, and José Theodore. 2019. “Power outages during NHL games (updated)”, Canadian Hockey Dataverse, doi:10.1234/nhl.lnh.haha\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy data citations\nThe Data Citation Principles note that (emphasis added):\n\nSound, reproducible scholarship rests upon a foundation of robust, accessible data. For this to be so in practice as well as theory, data must be accorded due importance in the practice of scholarship and in the enduring scholarly record. In other words, data should be considered legitimate, citable products of research. Data citation, like the citation of other evidence and sources, is good research practice and is part of the scholarly ecosystem supporting data reuse.\n\n\nData citation increases the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and re-usability of research data (known as FAIR).\nThrough data citations, data providers can link to articles (sometimes automatically), allowing them to show the academic value of the data and continue providing the services around data creation.\nData citations open a new path to finding relevant science, by reaching the linked articles through data search interfaces, like openICPSR, Data-Pass, and Google Dataset Search.\n\n\n\nGeneric Guidance\nThe AEA follows the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS), with several additions on the AEA website. As the CMOS states, one of the criteria for a useful citation is conveying authority and permanence:\n\nElectronic content presented without formal ties to a publisher or sponsoring body has the authority equivalent to that of unpublished or self-published material in other media.\n\nThey also note that\n\nAuthors should note that anything posted on the internet is “published” in the sense of copyright and must be treated as such for the purposes of complete citation and clearance of permissions, if relevant.\n\nSeveral standard citations options may be relevant for data citations:\n\nWebsites\nWhen citing information from websites, including data downloaded from websites, use the general website citation style for data:\n\n\nGoogle. 2017. “Privacy Policy.” Privacy & Terms. Last modified April 17, 2017. https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\nYale University. n.d. “About Yale: Yale Facts.” Accessed May 1, 2017. https://www.yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts.\n\n\nNote that this does NOT apply when the data have a permanent URL, a DOI, or a suggested citation!\n\nNote that the AEA suggests using footnotes for some types of websites (Newspapers, Online Encyclopedias, and Reference Works). You should use the full citation with entry in the list of references for data downloaded from websites.\n\n\n\nGithub\nMany researchers now use Github to store code or documents. How should Github repositories (or for that matter, Gitlab or Bitbucket) repositories be cited?\nAny online repository can be deleted by its owner at any time, and in that sense, are no more or less robust than websites, and the same rules apply:\n\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). “A template README for social science replication packages.” Github. https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/. Accessed 2021-07-01.\n\n\nHowever, online repositories do provide the ability to make releases, providing a better way to pin changes made over time. While this does not change the fundamental treatment as a website, it is a more robust reference:\n\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). “A template README for social science replication packages.” Github. Release v1.0.0). https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README/releases/tag/v1.0.0. Accessed 2021-07-01.\n\n\nHowever, Github is currently unique among online repositories in enabling an automatic integration with Zenodo for the purpose of “making code citable” (and preserving versions). This changes the citation, because Zenodo-preserved versions are no longer subject to arbitrary deletion. Once a Github website has been preserved on Zenodo, it can be cited as any document or archive with a DOI:\n\n\nVilhuber, Lars, Connolly, Marie, Koren, Miklós, Llull, Joan, & Morrow, Peter. (2020). A template README for social science replication packages (Version v1.0.0). Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4319999\n\n\nOf note: while Github is unique in its automatic integration, any release of an online code repository can be manually preserved on Zenodo, then cited in the above fashion.\n\n\nOnline databases\nCMOS has a recommendation for online databases:\n\n\nNASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (object name IRAS F00400+4059; accessed April 6, 2016). http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/.\n\n\nwhich would be cited in the text as NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database.\n\n\nData distributed as supplementary data\nThe CMOS provides examples of how to cite supplementary materials that are attached to a specific article:\n\n\nSuárez-Rodríguez, M. and C. Macías Garcia. 2014. “There Is No Such a Thing as a Free Cigarette: Lining Nests with Discarded Butts Brings Short-Term Benefits, but Causes Toxic Damage.” Journal of Evolutionary Biology 27, no. 12 (December 2014): 2719–26, https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.12531, data deposited at Dryad Digital Repository, https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.4t5rt.\n\n\nThe AEA guidance used to provide an example, in which the citation links to the article landing page:\n\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks: Dataset.” American Economic Review. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763.\n\n\nNote however that modern data citation guidance suggest that both the article and the data used by the article should be cited, and this can lead to confusion. With the 2019 move of the AEA to a data archive, the correct citation for the above supplement would be:\n\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “Replication data for: The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks.” American Economic Association [publisher], * Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research distributor*, https://doi.org/10.3886/E112357V1\n\n\nwith the article also cited as:\n\n\nRomer, Christina D., and David H. Romer. 2010. “The Macroeconomic Effects of Tax Changes: Estimates Based on a New Measure of Fiscal Shocks” American Economic Review. no. 3 (June 2010): 763–801. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.100.3.763.\n\n\n\n\nCiting the paper or the data?\nSeveral data distributors already request or require citation as per their terms of use, or as a note on their websites. Often, following traditional usage, they request citation of a published article, not of the data. For example, the widely used “Penn World Tables” request that the article that introduced this version of the Penn tables be cited:\n\n\nFeenstra, Robert C, Robert Inklaar, and Marcel P Timmer. 2015.”The next generation of the Penn World Table.” American Economic Review, 105(10): 3150-82.\n\n\nHowever, they also provide a DOI that redirects to the data download page, with various versions of the tables receiving different DOIs. In particular, various of these versions were created after the original article (and database) were published, and are not published in the AER.\nThus, for accurate citations as well as compliance with data citation principles, in addition to citing the Feenstra et al (2015) article as requested by the data provider, authors should also correctly cite the data:\n\n\nRobert C. Feenstra, Robert Inklaar and Marcel P. Timmer. 2016. “Penn World Table 9.0.” Groningen Growth and Development Centre. https://doi.org/10.15141/S5J01T.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Guidance\nThe key to data citations is that the creator, the name, the location, and the date last accessed for a data source should be clear. This pertains to online data, offline data, physical data, whether it is in boxes or on tapes, or in a corporate database behind a firewall.\nICPSR notes that a citation should include the following items:\n\nAuthor\nTitle\nDistributor\nDate\nVersion\nPersistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)\n\nNote that all but the URN would apply also for an offline database. Consider the citation of objects in archives:\n\nProducer\nOften, the creator of a dataset is an organization. The same way that an organization as a work’s author can be cited:\n\n\nISO (International Organization for Standardization). 1997. Information and Documentation—Rules for the Abbreviation of Title Words and Titles of Publications. ISO 4:1997. Paris: ISO.\n\n\nan organization can be cited as the creator of a dataset:\n\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nDistributor\nIn many cases, the data are not distributed by the creator. This means the distributor takes on the role of a publisher (of a book, of data). So if using Compustat through the Wharton Research Data Services, one might cite as\n\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). 2017. Compustat-Capital IQ. Wharton Research Data Services. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/\n\n\nIf using the S&P 500 data, there may be multiple providers:\n\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P 500 [SP500], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SP500, January 24, 2020.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, S&P 500, provided via Haver Analytics Data Subscription, February 24, 2018.\n\n\nwith hopefully the same content. Note that often, such data is subject to copyright and redistribution restrictions (see the page at FRED on SP500).\n\n\nDates\nIn some cases, it isn’t clear when the dataset was published, though it may be clear what time period the dataset covers. One way to address this may be by using the “n.d.” abbreviation for the date of publication:\n\n\nStandard and Poor’s (S&P). n.d. Compustat-Capital IQ (1982-2017). Wharton Research Data Services. Accessed April 6, 2018. https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/about/data-vendors/sp-global-market-intelligence/\n\n\n\n\nMany related datasets\nA related issue may arise when the dataset is comprised of multiple years, each of which has its own DOI. For instance, when accessing multiple years of American Community Survey data on ICPSR, each of which has its own DOI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2002\n(ICPSR 3893)\n\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1998\n(ICPSR 3888)\n2008-05-21\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1997\n(ICPSR 3886)\n2008-05-21\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2003\n(ICPSR 4117)\n2009-12-01\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2004\n(ICPSR 4370)\n2008-10-14\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2009\n(ICPSR 33802)\n2013-04-04\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n2008\n(ICPSR 29263)\n2011-11-08\n\n\nAmerican Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),\n1996\n(ICPSR 3885)\n2008-05-21\n\n\n\nOne approach to this is to create a composite citation, with additional information available in an online data appendix or a Data Availability Statement:\n\n\nBureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor DOIs listed in data appendix.\n\n\nor\n\n\nBureau Of The Census. 2009. “American Community Survey (ACS): Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS), 1997-2009.” United States Department Of Commerce [publisher]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. distributor https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/search/studies?q=american+community+survey (accessed November 21, 2019)\n\n\n(and listing of exact DOIs in an appendix table).\n\n\nOffline access mechanism\nMany datasets are available only under license, memorandum, contract, etc., and do not have a formal online presence. This is quite similar to traditional offline archives, for instance manuscript collections. For such collections, CMOS suggests:\n\n\nKallen, Horace. Papers. YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, New York.\nMerriam, Charles E. Papers. Special Collections Research Center, box 26, folder 17. University of Chicago Library.\n\n\nand usage in the text as\n\nAlvin Johnson, in a memorandum prepared sometime in 1937 (Kallen Papers, file 36), observed that …\n\nSimilar citations can be constructed for offline databases:\n\n\nBloom, Nick. 2019. Confidential survey data on Cameroon business processes. Stanford Secure Access Center (file “cameroon-bloom.zip”). Stanford University.\n\n\n\n\nConfidential databases\nSimilar forms may be used for confidential databases when no DOI exists:\n\n\nInternal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Department of Treasury, Washington DC, accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n\nwhere the data, in this case, were accessed via the “Department of Treasury,” acting as a secure distributor (of access, not downloads). If the same data had been accessed via a secure research data center, the reference should have instead noted that access mechanism:\n\n\nInternal Revenue Service. (YEAR). Corporate Income Tax Returns [database]. Federal Research Data Centers distributor, last accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\nNational Tax Administration. 2015. “Társasági Adóalanyok Mérleg - és Eredménykimutatásai [Dataset].” Magyar Nemzeti Bank distributor. Last accessed at YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n\nIf multiple databases within the same secure confines are used and combined, they should be cited (within reason) separately. Guidance here may be: Can and do researchers combine various extracts in different ways? For instance, do some combine the IRS 1040 database with death records, and others merge elements from the IRS 1040 database with information returns? Then the information returns, and the 1040 file should be cited separately.\n\nGovernment registers\nIn some cases, governments have list of their (named) registers. For instance, Statistics Denmark provides the full list of registers at https://www.dst.dk/extranet/forskningvariabellister/Oversigt%20over%20registre.html. These can be used to craft data citations, for instance\n\n\nStatistics Denmark. 2020. “Døde i Danmark (DOD, Deaths in Denmark), 1970-2019 [database]”, Danmarks Statistiks Forskningsservice, accessed YYYY-MM-DD.\n\n\nwhere the “author” is Statistics Denmark, but the “[publisher]” is the research service of Statistics Denmark. You should note the version (for instance, the current register goes through 2019, but you may have had access to an earlier version, so you should adjust accordingly). In the manuscript, you would then cite “Statistics Denmark (2020)”. If available, the README can point to the codebook for each register, e.g., https://www.dst.dk/extranet/ForskningVariabellister/DOD%20-%20D%C3%B8de%20i%20Danmark.html for the aforementioned “DOD” register. An example can be found in Fadlon and Nielsen (2021).\n\n\nConfidential data with DOI\nIf a DOI exists, the formal citation generated from that DOI should be used:\n\n\nForschungsdatenzentrum der Bundesagentur für Arbeit. 2020. “Betriebs-Historik-Panel (BHP) – Version 7518 v1.” Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB). https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.BHP7518.DE.EN.V1.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo formal access mechanism\nIn some cases (not infrequently), access to data is through informal means. The CMOS allows for citation of such information, without inclusion in the references.\n\n\n(A. P. Møller, unpublished data; C. R. Brown and M. B. Brown, unpublished data)\n\n\nWe would deviate from that suggestion, ask for inclusion in the reference list, and simply suggest using unpublished data as the locator, similar to a URN, in the reference list:\n\n\nMøller, A. P. n.d. “Data on Crocodile Sightings in Manhattan.” Unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2019.\n\n\n\n\nData provider cannot be named\nIn some cases, the data provider (often a firm) must remain anonymous. This does not prevent citation, and the provider should be mentioned in much the same way as when there is no formal access mechanism:\n\n\nAnonymous Firm. 1999. “Personnel records of windowshield installers.” Unpublished data. Accessed February 29, 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out\n{% include citation-generator.html %}",

    "text": "Journals offer guidance on citation, you may want to check there first. The guidance provided here is in addition, and may be the basis for future official guidance.\n\nData Citations\nProperly referencing data goes beyond just reproducibility - it is also proper scientific writing style. In the same way that authors use bibliographic references to “printed” resources, they should also be using such references for data resources, to give and receive credit where credit is due. Not referencing an article or book is at best an oversight, and at worst plagiarism - and the same should apply to data objects. Numerous guides and tutorials exist, some of which provide a variety of examples.\n\nDataONE Tutorial on Data Citation and generic guidance\nICPSR\nForce11’s Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principals\nthe AEA’s Sample References\nMichigan State University\nUC Santa Cruz\nOSF\n\n\n\nWhat to cite\nIn a nutshell, every dataset is to be cited. This is true for the main article as well as online appendices. In the past, use of data or code has been acknowledged in footnotes, and only rarely through bibliographic references. However, if the dataset is used, it should appear in the bibliography. The same is true for code reused from previous papers, or provided by authors.\n\nData is published\nThe DOI is thus public, and all repositories will provide a suggested citation. One can also use https://www.doi2bib.org/ or https://citation.crosscite.org/ to get a citation (see below for additional tools).\n\n\nData is not published\nThis is trickier. The data does not necessarily have a title that is related to the paper. Some repositories allow authors to “reserve” a DOI (Zenodo) or to delay publication. For some repositories, the DOI, while not officially reserved, can be derived from information already available (see this FAQ for openICPSR, something similar may be possible at Dataverse).\nIn some cases, authors may be able to delay publication, and coordinate it with the publication of the article (openICPSR, possibly Zenodo).\n\n\n\nWhere to cite\nIn all cases, data and code should be cited in the main manuscript. They should also be referenced in the data availability statement (some journals) or the README (other journals).\n\n\nHow to cite\nMany journals in economics require the Chicago style for citations and bibliographies 1. However, the Chicago Style Manual provides few relevant examples for data citations. Applications like Zotero and Mendeley Desktop also do not support data citations robustly, even though the underlying Citation Style Language has had the concept of a “data” entry for several years.\nDataONE suggests content and style that resemble the generic working paper or article citation style (adapted to Chicago style):\n\nWestbrook JW, Kitajima K, Burleigh JG, Kress WJ, Erickson DL, Wright SJ (2011) Data from: What makes a leaf tough? Patterns of correlated evolution between leaf toughness traits and demographic rates among 197 shade-tolerant woody species in a neotropical forest. Dryad Digital Repository. http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.8525\n\nICPSR notes that a citation should include the following items: - Title - Author - Date - Version - Persistent identifier (such as the Digital Object Identifier, Uniform Resource Name URN, or Handle System)\nand provides a few examples, with some additional modifiers:\n\nEsther Duflo; Rohini Pande, 2006, ``Dams, Poverty, Public Goods and Malaria Incidence in India’’, http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/IOJHHXOOLZ UNF:5:obNHHq1gtV400a4T+Xrp9g== Murray Research Archive [Distributor] V2 [Version]\n\nFinally, the AEA style guide suggests\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.’’ Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. ICPSR05404-v1. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404 (accessed February 8, 2011).\n\nThis may be adjusted. An alternate citation may be\n\nLeiss, Amelia. 1999. ``Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945–1968.’’ Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, MI. ICPSR05404-v1. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404.\n\nCitations to primary data can sometimes be hard to construct. If the data provider has a suggested citation, then you should use it. Alternatively, you can construct as per the above examples, for instance, as noted on the AEA style guide:\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” United States Department of Labor. http://data.bls.gov/cgi- bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).\n\n\n\nSome additional guidance on tricky citations\n\nAdditional guidance on Data Citations.\nData citation without an online link\nSample (unofficial) citations for Census Bureau datasets in the FSRDC can be found on Zotero.org and on Github.\n\n\n\nSome Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen providing data citations, please be sure to check that a URL is given. However, there are some subtleties:\n\nIf only a single file is downloaded from a website, the data citation should include the precise URL (https://data.com/path/to/file), not just a top-level URL (https://data.com)\nIf a URL is giving starting with “https://doi.org”, then it is a DOI. Those do not need access dates. Otherwise, a website access needs a URL (by most citation styles).\nBe sure to provide the DOI when both a DOI and a URL is available. A DOI is stable, a URL may not be.\nAlways check the URL by clicking on it, Sometimes, the URL turns out to be generic/top-level, and does not show the file the replicator should be downloading. The replicator should be able to find the file using the URL, or with the instructions in the README.\n\nCheck for a license/data use agreement.\n\nJust because data is visible does not mean it can be redistributed. By default, it is not (copyright).\nRegardless of redistribution rights, the URL of the data use agreement should be included in the README/online appendix to fully describe data access conditions.\nIdeally, a copy of the data use agreement or license should be included in the replication archive. This can be a copy of an email authorizing you to distribute the data, or a copy of the data use agreement on the website when you downloaded the data (which might be different from the current data use agreement!)\n\nSome data use agreements may also require specific citations (of papers, of code). Verify that you are compliant with all such requirements!\n\nThe same actually applies for Stata or R packages that may be downloaded.\nIt is R practice to cite all packages, and R makes that easy. This should be noted in the report, if not done. Citation in the README should be sufficient.\nIn Stata, some packages have citation requirements. Check the website of the author, sometimes also the *.ado file the author downloads. For instance, many authors use “reghdfe”. See https://github.com/sergiocorreia/reghdfe#citation for a citation requirement.\n\n\n\n\nTools\nNo tool is perfect, but you will likely find the one that works for your particular workflow. Some examples for specific software: - BibTeX - BibLaTeX - Zotero will have native dataset functionality starting in version 5.1, for now, some guidance for entering it can be found in forums. Note that support in the citation styles is also still lacking. - Mendeley Desktop.\n\nTools when the object has a DOI\nThere are several websites that will create a (data) citation from any DOI. Give these a try:\nDOI Citation Formatter at citation.crosscite.org/ is supported by the DOI Registration Agencies. For instance, using 10.3886/ICPSR05404 from the above example, it generates (as of 2022-01-16):\n\nChicago Author-date (16th edition)\n\n{:.citation .goodcite} &gt; Leiss, Amelia. 1984. “Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945-1968.” ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. doi:10.3886/ICPSR05404.\n\nAPA style:\n\n{:.citation .goodcite} &gt; Leiss, A. (1984). Arms Transfers to Developing Countries, 1945-1968 [Data set]. ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research. https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05404\ndoi2bib at doi2bib.org/ will generate a BibTeX entry from a DOI (for instance from 10.3886/ICPSR05404):\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.3886/icpsr05404,\n  doi = {10.3886/ICPSR05404},\n  url = {http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/5404},\n  author = {Leiss,  Amelia},\n  language = {en},\n  title = {Arms Transfers to Developing Countries,  1945-1968},\n  publisher = {ICPSR - Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research},\n  year = {1984}\n}\n\n\nWhen the object does not have a DOI\nWhen the object does not have a DOI, it isn’t really that much more complicated, but little guidance is available.\n\nCitation Machine - choose Source type=Digital file and put the URL and access date into the Annotation field.\nTry our own tool:\n\n{% include citation-generator.html %}",

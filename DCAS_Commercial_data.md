title: Data Availability Statements for Commercial Data
---

Many economics papers use data from individual private companies, as well as from commercial data aggregators. Generally, these data cannot be redistributed by the author of a paper. Usage rights must be acquired from the original provider. This is not dissimilar from restricted data from statistical agencies, though there is significantly more variation in access procedures and cost.

This page uses a few examples, and suggested descriptions of data access for these examples. If you have an example to suggest for this page, send an email to dataeditor@aeaweb.org or [create a pull request](https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/guidance/pulls/new).

## Nielsen 

The [Nielsen Company](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en.html) provides various datasets through the Chicago Booth's [Kilts Center for Marketing](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/).

- Data access description: Researchers can subscribe to the data through the Kilts Center. There is a cost.

- As per the Kilts Center's policies (https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/nielsen/policies), presentations, papers, and publications must include the following citation:

>“Researcher(s) own analyses calculated (or derived) based in part on data from The Nielsen Company (US), LLC and marketing databases provided through the Nielsen Datasets at the Kilts Center for Marketing Data Center at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.”

>“The conclusions drawn from the Nielsen data are those of the researcher(s) and do not reflect the views of Nielsen. Nielsen is not responsible for, had no role in, and was not involved in analyzing and preparing the results reported herein.”

Adding those paragraphs into the title page footnote has been found to be sufficient in past papers (see Kilts Center SSRN).

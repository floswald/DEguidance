<img src="https://datacodestandard.org/assets/img/logo-800.png" height="15px" /> The [Data and Code Availability Standard (DCAS)](https://datacodestandard.org/) is a standard for sharing research code and data, endorsed by [leading journals](https://datacodestandard.org/journals) in social sciences. See [https://datacodestandard.org/](https://datacodestandard.org/) for more information.

The [template README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) provided on this website is in a form that follows best practices as defined by a number of data editors at social science journals. 

The most recent version is available at [https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/).

## Discussion forum for (Data) Editors

We have a (low-intensity) mailing list for data and reproducibility editors, and a more active working group that meets monthly, and maintains these resources.
We use a mailing list for discussion.

- to join general list, send email to [socsci-data-editors-l-request@cornell.edu](mailto:socsci-data-editors-l-request@cornell.edu?subject=join) with subject line "join". Approval required. You might contact any one of the working group members prior to sending the email.
- to join the active working group, contact [Lars Vilhuber](mailto:lars.vilhuber@cornell.edu). Meetings are usually first Monday of the month, 11:00AM Eastern/17:00 Central European time.
 
## Guidance on creating replicable data and program archives for authors

This guidance is for the author wanting to create a replication archive.

See [Requested information](Requested_information.md) for the information the Data Editor may request from you, prior to the acceptance of your paper for publication.

## Guidance on testing replicability of code

> Out of date.

This guidance has two audiences:

 - the author wanting to verify whether her code passes muster as a replicable archive
 - the replicator wanting to verify the replicability of such an archive

See [Verification guidance](Verification_guidance.md) 

## Journal-specific policies

Below is a selective list of policies from journals that actively verify compliance with policies through review of data, code, and documentation. 

See [Journal Policy Pages](journal-policies.md)

If you see a journal absent from this list, please [suggest an addition](https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/guidance/edit/master/journal-policies.md) (Github login required).

## Guidance to journals

- We suggest that journals require the  [template README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/), as it provides effective guidance to authors and, when correctly filled out, useful information for replicators. 
- We encourage journals to adopt the [Data and Code Availability Standard (DCAS)](https://datacodestandard.org/) as a basis for their data and code availability policy.
- We provide some guidance on [how to choose a repository for replication packages](assets/docs/Journal_guide_to_choosing_repositories.pdf), but also encourage journals to accept replication packages from any trusted repository, as long as the content is compliant with the journal's policy.

On this page, we list a few commonly used *lightly* or *heavily* restricted data and their data availability statements or licenses, when these are not otherwise easily available.

This page uses a few examples, and suggested descriptions of data access for these examples. If you have an example to suggest for this page, send an email to dataeditor@aeaweb.org or [create a pull request](https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/guidance/pulls/new).

### US Census Bureau and FSRDC

Adapted from [Fort (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdw057), Supplementary data:


> To reproduce the tables and figures in the paper:
> 1. All the results in the paper use confidential microdata from the U.S. Census Bureau. To gain
access to the Census microdata, follow the directions here on how to write a proposal for access
to the data via a Federal Statistical Research Data Center:
https://www.census.gov/ces/rdcresearch/howtoapply.html.
>2. You must request the following datasets in your proposal:
>   - Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), 2002 and 2007
>   - Foreign Trade Database – Import (IMP), 2002 and 2007
>   - Annual Survey of Manufactures (ASM), including the Computer Network Use      Supplement (CNUS), 1999
>   - [...]
>   - Annual Survey of Magical Inputs (ASMI), 2002 and 2007
>3. Reference “Technology and Production Fragmentation: Domestic versus Foreign   Sourcing” by Teresa Fort, project number br1179 in the proposal. This will give you access to   the programs and input datasets required to reproduce the results. Requesting a search of archives   with the articles DOI ("10.1093/restud/rdw057") should yield the same results. 
>
>   NOTE: Project-related files are available for 10 years as of 2015.

### NBER-CES Manufacturing Database

The files should be cited as "[NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database (1958-2011)](https://www.nber.org/nberces/)". You should also cite the earlier working paper as documentation. Please cite these in the manuscript. As per the NBER website,
